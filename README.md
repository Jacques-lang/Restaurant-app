This is an android app which covers some state management.
This app is basically a pseudo restaurant app which the user can use to order meals while in the restaurant and get the total and pay.
A ViewModel is used to take care of everything under the hood including states, and calculations.
Navigations are also used to create a seemless environment for the user to go through meal choices essentially and get their check out summary
